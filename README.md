# complement

Local complementation is a basic operation in graph theory. This repo holds a small interactive visualisation for local complementation operations.

This mini-tool was developed as part of my research for my Part III Mathematics Tripos. The topic was "Measurement-based quantum computing".
Local complementation arises naturally as a primitive in the theory of graph states, which are collections of qubits, one for each node of
a graph, which are then entangled pairwise along the edges of the graph. Local complementation is tied to the theory of local Clifford operations.
